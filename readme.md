Homework 2 Project

In this project the task was to designed a responsive website that renders well on a wide variety of device and window screen sizes. Bootstrap was used to develop our portfolio site
with a portfolio site with navbars, responsive layout and responsive images. The sites were designed using bootstrap's grid system using containers, rows and columns. An
HTML validation service was used to ensure that each of the pages has valid HTML.

The home page is a page with my name and a summary about myself.

The contact page is a page where users can contact me by providing their name, email address and a short message that describes their reason for contact.

The portfolio page is a page dedicated to some photos of myself to help enrich the feel of the website.

Welcome to my portfolio site!
